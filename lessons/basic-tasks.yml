title: "Basic Tasks Using a Jupyter Notebook with Code in Python for Analytical Chemistry Data Analysis"

# Brief description for search results (1-2 sentences)
description: "This Jupyter notebook can be used to generate code in Python to perform four basic tasks: Basic calculations; Entering data into NumPy arrays; Fitting data in NumPy arrays to a NumPy or SciPy nonlinear model function; Creating a Matplotlib graph of data in NumPy arrays and of a nonlinear model function."

# Longer description for the lesson page (use | for multi-line text)
expanded_description: |
  This lesson was used as an introduction to Analytical Chemistry Data Analysis tasks in Python.
  The suggested context would be to walk through it together during the first week of Analytical Laboratory.
  About 45 minutes to an hour should be allocated to this lesson.
  
  You can use multiple paragraphs to fully describe the lesson scope
  and learning experience.
