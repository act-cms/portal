expanded_description: |
  This lesson introduces students to the fundamental ways molecules are represented in computational chemistry and cheminformatics, with a focus on practical skills using Jupyter notebooks. Students will explore how chemical structures are encoded as data (e.g., SMILES, InChI, and molecular graphs), and learn to manipulate and visualize these representations using Python.

  Designed for introductory chemistry students with beginner programming experience, the module bridges core chemical concepts with modern computational tools. Through hands-on activities, students will gain experience reading, interpreting, and generating molecular representations, and will use open-source libraries to analyze and visualize molecular structures.

  By the end of the lesson, students will understand the importance of molecular representations in computational science, be able to apply basic programming to chemical problems, and develop foundational skills for further study in cheminformatics and molecular modeling. This lesson supports the integration of computational thinking into general chemistry curricula and prepares students for more advanced topics in molecular science.
