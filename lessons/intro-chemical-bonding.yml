title: "Introduction to Chemical Bonding"
description: "Learn the basics of ionic and covalent bonds, including electron sharing and transfer mechanisms."
expanded_description: |
  This comprehensive lesson introduces students to the fundamental principles of chemical bonding, 
  covering both ionic and covalent interactions. Through interactive Jupyter notebook exercises, 
  students will explore how atoms combine to form compounds and understand the driving forces 
  behind chemical reactions.

  The lesson combines theoretical concepts with computational examples, allowing students to 
  visualize molecular structures and calculate bonding energies using Python libraries. Students 
  will work with real chemical data and learn to interpret bonding patterns across the periodic table.
