title: "Computational Spectroscopy: Automated Data Analysis and Structure Elucidation"
description: "Apply machine learning and signal processing techniques to analyze NMR, IR, and UV-Vis spectroscopic data for molecular structure determination."
expanded_description: |
  This advanced lesson integrates spectroscopic theory with modern data science techniques to automate 
  spectral interpretation and structure elucidation. Students will develop computational workflows for 
  processing large spectroscopic datasets, implementing peak detection algorithms, and using machine 
  learning for pattern recognition.

  Through hands-on programming exercises, students will build tools for automated peak assignment, 
  baseline correction, and multivariate analysis of spectroscopic data. The lesson emphasizes 
  reproducible research practices and development of robust analytical pipelines.
