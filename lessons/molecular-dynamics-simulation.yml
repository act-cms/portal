title: "Molecular Dynamics Simulations: From Algorithm to Analysis"
description: "Build molecular dynamics simulations from scratch and analyze protein folding dynamics using computational methods."
expanded_description: |
  This intermediate-level lesson guides students through the implementation and analysis of molecular 
  dynamics simulations. Starting with basic integration algorithms, students will build a complete 
  MD simulation engine and apply it to study protein conformational dynamics.

  Students will learn to implement force field calculations, integrate equations of motion, and 
  analyze complex trajectory data. The lesson emphasizes both the theoretical foundations of MD 
  simulations and practical computational skills for biomolecular research.
