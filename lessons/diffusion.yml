# STARTER TEMPLATE FOR ACT-CMS LESSON PORTAL SUBMISSION
# Replace all placeholder text with your actual lesson information
# Remove any sections that don't apply to your lesson

# BASIC METADATA (REQUIRED)
# Use a clear, descriptive title that includes the main topic
title: "Diffusion from the Atomistic to Continuum Scale"

# Brief description for search results (1-2 sentences)
description: "Explore ways to measure and model diffusion computationally, starting with molecular dynamics in a web app and then moving to a Fickian continuum description."

# Longer description for the lesson page (use | for multi-line text)
expanded_description: |
  Explore diffusion at multiple lengthscales, no coding experience required! 
  Students will start by collecting their "experimental" data using a 2D molecular dynamics (MD) web app and 
  by stepping through this notebook, will see how one can extract a diffusivity from mean squared displacement
  across particles. 

  Next, they will connect this to the continuum (Fick's Laws) description and investigate how the intuitive notion
  of diffusion (how material "spreads out") connects to the atomistic picture from Brownian motion.

  Along the way, there are prompts to reflect on both the conceptual content as well as the complementarity between
  the experimental and computational paradigms.

  Additional context for instructors using this lesson:
  
  - This lesson works well when paired with a traditional lecture on molecular dynamics
  - Students often struggle with the concept of periodic boundary conditions in Part 2
  - The visualization exercises are very engaging - allow extra time for exploration
  - Consider assigning the dataset analysis as homework rather than in-class work
  
  Timing notes:
  - Part 1 typically takes students 45-60 minutes
  - Part 2 can be rushed in 90 minutes but is better with 2 hours
  
  Common student questions:
  - "Why do we need so many time steps?" - good opportunity to discuss numerical integration
  - "What happens if we change the temperature?" - this connects well to thermodynamics concepts
