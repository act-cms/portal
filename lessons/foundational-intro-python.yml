# BASIC METADATA (REQUIRED)
title: "Introduction to Programming for Molecular Scientists"
description: "Learn fundamental programming concepts in Python including data types, file operations, and basic programming structures."
expanded_description: |
  This foundational module introduces students to programming concepts essential for computational molecular science. 
  Students will learn Python basics including variables, data types, control structures, and file operations through 
  hands-on exercises designed for scientific applications.

  The module emphasizes practical programming skills that serve as prerequisites for more advanced computational 
  lessons in chemistry and molecular sciences.

# COURSE INFORMATION (REQUIRED)
programming_skill: "None"

also_for:
  - "Physical Chemistry"
  - "Materials Science"
authors: 
  - "Dr. Jessica A. Nash"
  - "Prof. Ashley McDonald"
estimated_time: "2-3 hours"
format: "Multi-Part Materials Module"

# INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION (OPTIONAL)
instructor_email: "instructor-access@university.edu"
instructor_notes: |
  This introductory module works well as the first programming lesson for students with no coding experience.
  
  Teaching tips:
  - Students often need extra time with the file reading concepts in Part 2
  - Encourage students to experiment with the code examples
  - Common issue: students forget to run cells in order
