This module is designed to support the published laboratory experiment 'Ocean Acidification: Investigation and Presentation of the Effects of Elevated Carbon Dioxide Levels on Seawater Chemistry and Calcareous Organisms' by Jeffrey M.

# Longer description for the lesson page (use | for multi-line text)
expanded_description: |
  This lesson can be used to analyze pooled mass, pH, and titration data collected by students in an analytical chemistry laboratory.
  The suggested context would be to walk through it together in the analytical laboratory after data collection.
  It would be helpful if students have completed the Statistical Testing module prior to this one.
  At least an hour at the end of *each* lab period should be allocated to this data analysis module; this includes Week 1, when students
  have no module but should get a head start on reading, commenting, and modifying code so as not to be rushed in Week 2 and Week 3.
  
  You can use multiple paragraphs to fully describe the lesson scope
  and learning experience.

  This module provides practice to reinforce programming skills introduced in prior modules for students with no prior coding experience.

  Teaching tips:
  - If time permits during the first week of lab, discuss all relevant equilibria and common ions, and 
    prompt students to hypothesize what might happen to each measured ion as a result of added CO$_2$.
  - If time permits during the first week of lab, a review of statistical hypothesis testing might be useful.  
  - If time permits during the first week of lab, encourage students to work ahead through the Week 2 and Week 3 code.
    They can comment code, copy/paste and modify code from Week 2 to using Week 3, and recall how to apply statistical hypothesis testing.
  - Students will need to consolidate measured data into a shared class data spreadsheet during lab, then export CSV files to upload here.
    Please provide the blank spreadsheet templates for students to use in Week 2 and Week 3, and keep an eye out for possible data entry errors.
  - In Week 2, students will need to record the masses of their dry Gooch funnels before beginning the filtering process (see below).
  - In Week 3, students will re-weigh their seashells. Please remind students to subtract the masses of their dry Gooch filters before 
    entering their final seashell-only masses for comparison to their initial seashell masses.
  - It may be possible for seashell masses to slightly *increase* at moderate pH, if magnesium in the seawater combines with carbonate ions.
  - Ideally the students should have previously completed the Statistical Testing module, but if not, they may require detailed instructions
    as to how to properly rename, upload, and import CSV files.  
  - Students should work together in groups to ensure they are accountable to understand each part.  This is especially important for hypothesis testing.
  - Encourage students to share ideas but code/answer questions in their own copy of the notebook.
  - Remind students to save their own copy before they begin work.
  - Some students may have several Google accounts; remind them to be aware of which account is logged in when they save.
  
  Timing notes:
  - Week 1 has no module, but that time can and should be used to get a head start on the Week 2 and Week 3 modules.
  - In Week 2:
    -- Task 1 typically takes students 10-15 minutes.  Students should read carefully to find values needed in the code. (no data needed)
    -- Task 2 typically takes students 15-20 minutes, depending on their file handling skills.  Data entry errors in class data may surface,
       requiring everyone to re-download and re-upload the CSV files after correction.  (Ideally, checking first could prevent this.)
    -- Task 3 typically takes students 5-10 minutes.
    -- Task 4 typically takes students 10-15 minutes.  Students should read carefully to find values needed in the code. 
    -- Task 5 typically takes students 15-20 minutes.  Students should review statistical hypothesis testing including pooled Student's T tests.
  - In Week 3:
    -- Task 1 typically takes students 10-15 minutes.  Students should read carefully and check their lab notebook to find values needed in the code. 
    -- Task 2 typically takes students 15-20 minutes, depending on their typing and file handling skills.  Copy/paste/modify coding requires attention to detail.
       Data entry errors in class data may surface, requiring everyone to re-download and re-upload the CSV files after correction.  
       (Ideally, reminding students to subtract the initial masses of their Gooch funnels, and checking the class data spreadsheet, could prevent this.)
    -- Task 3 typically takes students 10-15 minutes, depending on their typing skills.  Copy/paste/modify coding requires attention to detail.
    -- Task 4 typically takes students 15-20 minutes, depending on their typing skills.  Copy/paste/modify coding requires attention to detail.
    -- Task 5 typically takes students 15-20 minutes, depending on their typing skills.  Copy/paste/modify coding requires attention to detail.
  
  Common student questions:
  - Students may ask how to download CSV files, how to rename them, and how to import them into the Jupyter notebook.
  - Students may notice a large variation in class data results.  Often this is normal, but sometimes it is a sign of data entry errors.  
  - Students who have gotten ahead may need to be prompted to re-download, re-upload, re-import, and re-calculate if errors are found in class data.
  - If students need to recalculate anything after the lab period, they may need to be prompted to re-import the class data first.
  - Especially in Week 3, students may see results that do not confirm their hypotheses, and/or may see results that are not statistically significant.
    This is an opportunity to review statistical uncertainty, statistical significance, and/or possible small deviations from the published protocol.
