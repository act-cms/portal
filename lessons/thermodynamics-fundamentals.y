title: "Computational Thermodynamics: Energy Landscapes and Molecular Behavior"
description: "Explore thermodynamic principles through molecular simulations and computational analysis of energy landscapes."
expanded_description: |
  This lesson integrates computational methods with fundamental thermodynamic concepts to provide students 
  with a quantitative understanding of energy, entropy, and equilibrium. Students will use Python to simulate 
  molecular systems, calculate thermodynamic properties, and visualize energy landscapes.

  Through hands-on computational exercises, students will explore how molecular-level behavior gives rise to 
  macroscopic thermodynamic properties. The lesson emphasizes the connection between statistical mechanics 
  and classical thermodynamics using modern computational tools.
