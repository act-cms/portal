    "expanded_description": "This lesson introduces students to the fundamental ways molecules are represented in computational chemistry and cheminformatics, with a focus on practical skills using Jupyter notebooks. Students will explore how chemical structures are encoded as data (e.g., SMILES, InChI, and molecular graphs), and learn to manipulate and visualize these representations using Python.\n\nDesigned for introductory chemistry students with beginner programming experience, the module bridges core chemical concepts with modern computational tools. Through hands-on activities, students will gain experience reading, interpreting, and generating molecular representations, and will use open-source libraries to analyze and visualize molecular structures.\n\nBy the end of the lesson, students will understand the importance of molecular representations in computational science, be able to apply basic programming to chemical problems, and develop foundational skills for further study in cheminformatics and molecular modeling. This lesson supports the integration of computational thinking into general chemistry curricula and prepares students for more advanced topics in molecular science.\n",

Students are first taken through fitting one file with an eye towards automation. In the second notebook, two automation options are described. The first, 'soft' automation, simply gives an organization to fitting a moderate number of files by hand. The second teaches students to use glob to find all files of a given type and then use a for loop to fit all files.\n\nThe provided datafiles show the chemiluminescence of bleach when reacted with luminol and peroxide. These files show a sharp rise from the initial reaction, then an exponential decay that has different rates depending on the concentration of the reactants. These notebooks are easily adapted to any set of experimental data showing an exponential decay, common in many kinetics experiments.\n",

That is, all they have to do with this\nJupyter notebook is run existing cells of code and in some cases paste in data or change one number. My goals\nwere to get the students thinking about how computation as a paradigm is distinct from pure theory and can \ncomplement both theory and experiment, e.g. by probing scales of length and time inaccessible in a physical\nlab, or through massive replication through automation.\n\nWhen I piloted this activity (in Carnegie Mellon's introductory materials science course), it was \nactually before they had seen anything about diffusion in the associated lecture. I think it could work well\nin either scenario, though, it would just affect how technical one should expect the students to get in their\nresponses to the reflection prompts, and also what context would be needed in the prelab mini-lecture. My pilot\naudience was also extremely heterogeneous in programming background, some first-year undergraduates with \nessentially no experience, and some more senior computer science students, and it worked just fine.\n\nFor my course, the deliverable was a standard lab memo that included responses to the reflection prompts within\nthe notebook, as well as this additional prompt: \"Please also write at least a few sentences reflecting on \ncomputation as an \"experimental\" paradigm generally. How do you see it as similar to or different from \nexperiments? What can we learn about diffusion more easily from one approach compared to the other?\"\n\nLogistical tips, and things to emphasize in prelab mini-lecture:\n- Demonstrate launching the notebook in chosen platform (I suggest ChemCompute), including setting the correct runtime!\n- Demonstrate using the online MD tool and getting the density up high enough (easiest technique is to use the \"freeze\" button and then drag the number slider up repeatedly)\n- Since the first two setup cells to install and import packages will take a few minutes to run, try to make sure students get those going first and then start reading and exploring the MD engine, etc.\n\nSome student \"gotchas\" I ran into a few times:\n- Not setting the correct runtime (e.g. they're in Python instead of Julia) so none of the code runs\n- Not evaluating the cells after pasting their data in\n- Data formatting issues due to either not pasting in the full contents of the data dump, resetting stats during data collection, etc.\n\nPossibilities to \"level up\" this activity for more advanced students:\n- Connect to 2D Lennard-Jones phase diagram (conditions here are in the two-phase solid-liquid region!) and thinking about why solid ends up in middle of box and liquid along the edges (see e.g. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49750821/figure/fig1/AS:667216336936969@1536088179352/Phase-diagram-of-2D-Lennard-Jones-solid-as-given-in-9-The-first-order-boundaries-are.png) \n- \"Skeletonize\" some of the code cells and ask students to fill in some of the analysis or visualization themselves\n- Get more in-depth into what's going on with the MD, understand why temperature drifts, etc.\n- Have them repeat the second portion at another temperature and think about how/why the results change\n- Dive more into some of the PDE stuff at the end\n",

See approximate timing below.\n- After the live coding session students should be ready to tackle the assignment outlined in the notebook for part 2. The assignment includes using the linear variation method to compute approximate solutions for a double-well potential and to examine properties of the ground state solution. \n\nTiming notes:\n- At the beginning of the live coding session, the instructor is encouraged to spend time reviewing the key steps of applying the method (section 3 of notebook) and highlight elements of code design.  \n- A three-hour live coding session should provide enough time for the instructor to complete part 1 and demonstrate 1) the application of the method, 2) use of SciPy functions for numerical integration and linear algebra, and 3) code design and debugging. A useful example could be a particle confined to an infinite well with a raised floor in the right half of the box. Approximately 2-2.5 hours for this would be appropriate. \n- Students are then asked to write their own code to obtain approximate solutions for a modified double-well potential.  This notebook can be assigned either as homework for students to complete on their own outside of class/lab or with instructor supervision during a 3-hour lab period. \n\nCommon student questions:\n\n- \"Students need several reminders related to the use of functions\"\n- \"Students, especially those with no linear algebra background, often have questions related to diagonalization and how it is equivalent to finding the optimal coefficients in the wave function expansion (the appendix addresses this)\"\n- \"Students often get confused between the quantum number index and the matrix index due to the zero offset in Python when building the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian\"\n",
